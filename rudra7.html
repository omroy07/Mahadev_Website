    </h2>
    <br>
    <p id = "p1">Once for some reason, there is controversy between Vishnu and Brahma. They are going to fight with each. At the moment, Shivlingam appear which seem to infinite at both ends, for upper end and lower. Brahma and Vishnu see this column of fire and they ask each other that what is this? Why it appears? Where is end of fire column?

        To find end, Brahma go to upper side and Vishnu go to downside. 
        
        After thousands of years, they can't find end. Vishnu return and say "Neti Neti" means it have no end.
        
        Brahma also can't find upper side from column start but he see flower of Ketaki fall down. He ask to Ketaki, From when you fall and where is this fire column start? 
        
        Ketaki says, I fall from too long time but it seem no starting.
        
        Brahma want to return but without finding starting, they feel insult against Vishnu. So they ask Ketaki to witness in lie when they say Vishnu that they find starting. Ketaki agree. After both return.
        
        Vishnu say truth that they can't find downside. But Brahma lie and say that they find end and for witness they say Ketaki saw me. Ketaki also lie and say that Brahma speak truth.
        
        As here harm of Dharma, Mahadev appears.
        
        
        
        
        
        They create Bhairav who is also one Avatar of them.
        
        Brahma have five heads. One head who speak lie is cutted by Bhairav.
        
        Lord Shiva say that because Brahma lie, they never worshipped.
        
        Brahma pray and request forgiveness, so Shiva say that there is one Temple where they worshipped.
        
        Shiva also say Ketaki that he will never worshipped in Shiva Temple. I deny you.
        
        Ketaki say that If you can't accept me then my life fail. Please give me forgiveness.
        
        By prayer Lord Shankar pleased and say, I will accept you when Parvati give Ketaki to Shivlingam on day of Kevadatrija. You will worshipped on one day of year.
        
        Bhairav have sin of Brahmahatya by cutting fifth head. One women appear who is Brahmahatya and follow them. Bhairav go almost everywhere but he can't get rid of her. When Bhairav reach Kashi, suddenly she disappeared. After Bhairav stay in Kashi and fulfill wishes of devotee.
        
        After giving forgiveness to Ketaki, Shiva says, Vishnu you are great. You speak truth and follow Dharma. Even at time of Bhairav cut head, you save him from cutting further more heads. You have great quality. I impressed on you and you are equal to me. 
        
        Lord Shiva not satisfied by making them equal and say that I accept you as God. You are my God.
        
        And as per Shiva Purana, Shiva accept Vishnu as their God from that time.
        
        Lord Shiva says, There is no difference between me and Vishnu. Devotee who insult Vishnu will fall in hell.
        
        Lord Vishnu also says, My devotee who insult God Shiva will go to hell. Devotee who pray to Shiva are also dear to me.
        
        So, never think wrong about Shri Vishnu because they are great devotee of Shiva.
        
        After Lord Shiva worship to Vishnu. Vishnu is God of Shiva and Shiva is God of Vishnu. They both are same and one can't differentiate them.
