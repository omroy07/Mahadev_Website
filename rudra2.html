        Story of testing great devotees 
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p id = "p1">Once Sage Atri have no son. So they pray to Lord Shiva and do Tapascharya. By his devotion, all three God pleased, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. They give boon to Sage that they will born as a son of him.

        Ansha of Brahma born as moon (Chandra).
        
        Ansha of Vishnu born as Datatreya and ansha of Shiva is Durvasha.
        
        Durvasa is sage who become angry to test devotee and to do welfare of world.
        
        Once he test devotion of King Ambarish.
        
        In Ekadashi, he come to palace of Ambarish. Because it is day of Ekadashi, Ambarish have fast. He have to drink water before next day. But Durvasa go to river for bath and to test him, not return from there. Time is passed. Ambarish worries because in Ekadashi he have to fulfill requirement of Vrata he can't because Sage not return and time of this day will pass. To not break Vrata, he take small amount of Water.
        
        Sage Durvasa also come after sometime. He knows that Ambarish drink water. So Rishi become angry.
        
        At that time Sudarshana chakra appear, try to kill Durvasha. But as he is Avatar of Shiva, celestial announcement happen which say Ambarish to stop Sudarshana chakra, else it can be harmful for you.
        
        Ambarish is great Vishnu Devotee, he pray to Vishnu.
        
        Chakra stop. Ambarish pass in test of Durvasa and Sage give them blessing.
        
        They also test Shri Ram in one situation.
        
        When time pass and Shri Rama have time to move from Earth, Lord Yama come.
        
        Yama is in form of Sage. He say Rama to discuss something in house and say that if anyone enter house then you must kill him. Shri Ram agree.
        
        Rama make Lakshamana a guard and tell that no one should enter.
        
        After they are in house and Lakshamana become Gatekeeper.
        
        To test Shri Rama, Durvasa comes there. Sage say Lakshamana to enter him in house. But as he know promise, he say no. Rishi become angry. So he go into house and send message of Durvasa to Ramchandra.       
        As per promise, Rama leave his brother.        
        Rama pass in exam, Durvasa impress on him and give blessing.
        In one event, Draupadi help Durvasha. Sage give her a blessing from she received cloth in Mahabharat.
        Also Rishi test devotion of Krishna. Lord Krishna pass on test where they take a place of horse in chariot.</p>
