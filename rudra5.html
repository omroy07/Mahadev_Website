    <p id = "p1">
        To test devotion of Upamanyu, Lord Shiva take Avatar of Indra which known as Sureshwar Avatar.
        
        Once Upamanyu is child. He want milk but his family is too poor that mother can't give milk. His mother give liquid of white color which seem as milk. When Upamanyu taste it, he know that it is different. He ask mother a reason.
        
        Mother give answer as they are poor and have not money to buy anything.
        
        Upamanyu ask solution to become rich. His mother says, Only Lord Shiva can give us richness. Only Shiva can fulfill your wishes. Mahadev is creator of world. So pray to them.
        
        Upamanyu want to solve and he ask mother to give him permission for Tapascharya. She give permission.
        
        Upamanyu go to Forest and pray Shiva with dedication. He meditate Shiva even it is winter, summer or monsoon.Day and night are equal for him, he continues to pray Shiva. Devotion of him is so powerful that Lord Shiva and Parvati know about him from Kailasa and want to give Darshana. But before, they want to test him.

        So, Lord Shiva become Indra as Sureshwar Avatar. Where Upamanyu do tapasya, they come. First Upamanyu bow to them. He ask, Who are you? What is reason to come here?
        
        Sureshwar reply, I am Indra, King of heaven. I have all power but to whom you pray?
        
        He says  I pray to Lord Shiva and do Yagya for them.
        
        Indra says, You not need to pray Shiva. You should pray me as I have all power. I will fulfill your wishes.
        
        Upamanyu become angry and say Indra to go away from there else he throw ash of yagya from anyone can die.
        
        But still Indra continue to say bad thing of Shiva.
        
        Upamanyu become very angry. He give last chance but still Indra continue. So he throw ash.
        
        As he throw, Nandi catch it in between. Lord Shiva and Parvati appear there.
        
        They give boon that he get enormous amount of wealth. He get sea of milk, fruits and butter. He become immortal. Geezerhood never come in life. He become famous and whatever he think will become true.
        
        Devi Parvati accept him as Son and give important place in Ganas.
        
        After in Dwapar Yuga, Krishna meet Upamanyu and make him a spiritual teacher. Lord Krishna do Tapascharya of 16 month of Shiva where Upamanyu teach them procedure of worship and give spiritual knowledge.
