        <p id = "p1">Once Hiranyakshipu try to kill Vishnu Bhakta Prahlad. He says, you can't chant name of Vishnu. I am superior and great.

            But still Prahlad pray with true heart. Devotion of him is such that any method of killing not work. Even if it snake, fire or fall from mountain. By Vishnu's name he saved from all dangers.
            
            One day Hiranyakshipu roped Prahlad to hot colomn. Prahlad have complete faith in God Vishnu. God care for him and they appear from hot column as Nrisimha Avatar.
            
            Hiranyakshipu have boon such as he can't die on day or night, he can't die by man, Devtas or any animals, he can't die by any type of Weapons.
            
            But Nrisimha is not man or animal, they are made from half body of man and half of Lion. They appear in evening which is not a day or night. They break all boons which save Hiranyakshipu from death.
            
            Bhagwan save their great devotee and kill Hiranyakshipu.
            
            After killing demon, anger of Nrisimha stay. Brahma and other Gods pray but still they are angry.
            
            Brahma and Devtas request Shiva to stop them. Shiva first send Virabhadra make them silent but they are so angry that can't listen to Virabhadra
            
            To save world from anger, Lord Shiva take Sharabha Avatar. They stop Nrisimha and realize them as they are Vishnu Avatar.
            
            In Shiva Purana and Ling Purana, this story mentioned. It is say that Animal named "Sharabha" are still found in Himalaya.
