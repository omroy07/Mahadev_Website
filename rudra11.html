    <p id = "p1">As Shiv Puran says, Hanuman is considered as 11th Rudra Avatar of Mahadev. Bhagwan Hanuman born by Anjani.

        Lord Hanuman is Brahmchari. Only goal of their life is Shri Ram. In their heart Sita and Ramchandra stay. They are great and dear to Rama.
        
        One who pray to Shri Rama, are dear to Hanuman and they protect him from every problem or any dangers. Many temples of Lord Hanuman are in kaliyuga and they still worshipped by devotee. One who is devotee of Shiva, should worship them.</p>
